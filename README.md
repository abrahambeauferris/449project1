Installation:

In order for the system to work, the files must all be in the same folder.
Once in a folder, you may use "javac Input.java" to compile in cmd line.

The file named "Input.java" is the main system file. To run the program,
you must use the command line arguments to specify an input file and output
file: "java Input someinput.txt someoutput.txt." If the output file is not
found, it will be created, but if there is no input file an exception will
be thrown. Once complete, the result (including all error cases) will be 
printed in the output file.

Command line steps:

1) javac Input.java
2) java Input someinput.txt someoutput.txt
